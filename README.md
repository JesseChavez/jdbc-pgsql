# Jdbc::Pgsql

This Ruby gem loads the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
Install this gem and `require 'jdbc/pgsql'` within JRuby

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jdbc-pgsql'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jdbc-pgsql

## Usage

This is a very minimal and basic sample.

```ruby
require 'jdbc/pgsql'

url = 'jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sample_database'

other_props = [
  'user=dev_user',
  'password=user_password'
].join('&')

connection = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(url + '?' + other_props)

statement = connection.createStatement

sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM users'

result = statement.executeQuery(sql_query)

while result.next
  puts [result.getString(1), result.getString(2), result.getString(3)]
end
```

For more details follow PostgreSQL Jdbc documentation and JRuby conventions to call java methods.
